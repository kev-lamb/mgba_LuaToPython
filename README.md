This is our Senior Design Project for the CIS Major at the University of Pennsylvania.

The goal of this project is to use reinforcement learning techniques to design two separate models that
will work in tandem to beat Pokemon Emerald in its entirety. The two models are as follows:

1. Battle Model: Handles all decisions relating to actions taken within a Pokemon battle

2. Traversal Model: Handles movement in the overworld, interacting with NPCs, etc.
